# Simple Flashcard Program

View the `data/french_words.csv` to see how to replicate proper CSV structure for the program. Change the top-level constant `LANGUAGE_CSV` in `main.py` to the new chosen file-name to work with your own files. Program will create a `words_to_learn.csv` in the `data` folder which will include the remaining words that need to be learned. After all words are exhausted, the file will be automatically deleted.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/Ezzahhh/simple-flashcards.git`
2. `cd simple-flashcards`
3. `python main.py`
